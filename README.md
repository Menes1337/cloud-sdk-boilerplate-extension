# Shopgate Cloud - Extension Boilerplate

This boilerplate contains all important folders and files which are required for an extension.

## Steps to start with the boilerplate

- Replace the `id` property in the file `extension-config.json` with the id of your extension
- Replace the `version` property in the file `extension-config.json` with version of your wish
- If you don't need a pipeline, remove the `awesomePipelines_v1.json` in the `pipelines` folder
- If you want to use a pipelines, modify the `awesomePipelines_v1.json` in the `pipelines` folder and rename it to the new name
